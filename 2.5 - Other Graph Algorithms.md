## Prim's Algorithm (Adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm), [GIF](assets/Prim.gif))

- Finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.
    - A minimum spanning tree is a subset of the edges that forms a tree, which contains every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.

1. Create a set `mstSet` that keeps track of the vertices already included in the MST.
2. Initialize key values for all the vertices in the graph as infinite, except for the starting node, which is assigned a value of 0 and is the root node for the MST.
4. While `mstSet` does not include all the vertices:
    1. Pick a vertex `u`, which is not in `mstSet` and has the minimum key value.
    2. Add `u` to `mstSet`.
    3. Update the key values of all adjacent vertices to `u`. For every adjacent vertex `v`, update the key value (and parent node) if the weight of the edge `u, v` is less than the previous key value of `v`.

```java
int[] primMST(int graph[][], int V) {
    int[] parent = new int[V];  // stores constructed MST
    int[] key = new int[V];  // key values
    boolean[] mstSet = new boolean[V];  // keeps track of which vertex is in MST

    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) key[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    key[0] = 0;
    parent[0] = -1;  // root of tree
    for (int count = 0; count < V - 1; count++) {
        int u = minKey(key, mstSet);  // pick the min. key vertex not in mstSet
        mstSet[u] = true;

        for (int v = 0; v < V; v++) {
            if (graph[u][v] != 0 && mstSet[v] == false && graph[u][v] < key[v]) {
                parent[v] = u;
                key[v] = graph[u][v];
            }
        }
    }

    return parent;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Adjacency Matrix Implementation: `O(|V|^2)`
- Binary Heap & Adjacency List Implementation: `O(|E| log |V|)`

## Kruskal's Algorithm (Adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm), [GIF](assets/Kruskal.gif))

- Finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.

1. Create a graph `F` (a set of trees), where each vertex of the input graph is a separate tree.
2. Create a set `S` containing all the edges of the graph.
3. While `S` is not empty and `F` is not yet spanning:
    1. Remove an edge with minimum weight from `S`.
    2. If the removed edge connects two different trees, then add it to the forest `F`, combining two trees into a single tree.

### Time Complexity

```
O(|E| log |E|) = O(|E| log |V|^2) = O(|E| * 2 log |V|) = O(|E| log |V|)
```

## Topological Sorting

- Linear ordering of a directed acyclic graph's nodes such that for every edge from node `u` to node `v`, `u` comes before `v` in the ordering.
- Can be implemented in a very similar fashion to DFS.

```java
void topologicalSort() {
    Stack stack = new Stack();

    boolean visited[] = new boolean[V];
    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        visited[i] = false;

    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        if (visited[i] == false)
            topologicalSortUtil(i, visited, stack);

    while (!stack.isEmpty())
        System.out.print(stack.pop() + " ");
}

void topologicalSortUtil(int v, boolean visited[], Stack stack) {
    visited[v] = true;

    Iterator<Integer> it = adjacent[v].iterator();
    while (it.hasNext()) {
        int i = it.next();
        if (!visited[i]) topologicalSortUtil(i, visited, stack);
    }

    stack.push(v);
}
```

### Time Complexity

```
O(|V| + |E|)
```
